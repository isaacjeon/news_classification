# News Article Classification

This project builds models to classify BBC news articles into their correct categories using natural language processing techniques. The text data was processed using **TF-IDF vectorization**, and two models were trained: **Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)** for topic modeling and a **Linear Support Vector Classifier (SVC)** for supervised classification. The LinearSVC model achieved an accuracy of 98.1%, outperforming the NMF model at 97.0%. This level of performance suggests that the model could be effectively applied to automate the classification of text data for tasks such as content organization, filtering, or topic-based recommendation systems.

The dataset can be found from the [BBC News Classification Kaggle competition](https://kaggle.com/competitions/learn-ai-bbc).
